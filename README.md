# world-cup-quiniela
Portfolio project for a World Cup prediction pool (quiniela) web application, focused on clean backend architecture, Spring Boot, and CI/CD practices.

---

## Project Overview

Quiniela Mundialista is a portfolio project designed to practice and demonstrate
modern backend and full-stack development practices using Spring Boot.

The application allows users to create private prediction groups, forecast match
results, earn points based on accuracy, and compete with friends through a ranking
system.

This project focuses on clean architecture, API-first design, and a realistic
development workflow rather than visual polish.

---

## Goals

- Practice backend development with Spring Boot
- Apply mobile-first and API-first design principles
- Implement authentication using JWT
- Use a lightweight Kanban workflow with GitHub Projects
- Integrate CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions
- Build a realistic, interview-ready portfolio project

---

## Current Status

- Wireframes
  - Landing page: **Done**
  - Login: **Done**
  - Register: **In progress**
- Backend implementation: **Not started**
- CI/CD: **Planned**

---

## Planned Features (MVP)

- User authentication (email & password)
- Create and join prediction groups (quinielas)
- World Cup match schedule
- Match result predictions
- Points calculation based on prediction accuracy
- Group rankings

---

## Tech Stack (Planned)

### Backend
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security (JWT)
- PostgreSQL
- Flyway (database migrations)

### Tooling & DevOps
- GitHub Projects (Kanban)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Docker (containerization)

### Frontend
- Web responsive UI
- Mobile-first design
- Wireframes created with Figma

---

## Development Process

This project follows a lightweight Kanban workflow using GitHub Projects:

Backlog → In Progress → Review → Done


Wireframes are created first to define user flows and API requirements before
backend implementation.

Each completed feature is intentionally kept within MVP scope to ensure clarity,
maintainability, and testability.

---

## Roadmap (Post-MVP)

- Password recovery flow
- Social login (Google / Apple)
- Email verification
- Enhanced statistics and analytics
- Deployment to a cloud provider
