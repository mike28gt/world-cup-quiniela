# Wireframes

This folder contains low-fidelity, mobile-first wireframes used to define user flows and backend API requirements.

## Purpose
Wireframes are intentionally simple and focus on:
- User flow clarity
- Required user actions
- Error states
- API-driven design

They are not intended to represent final UI or visual design.

## Screens included
- Landing: Public entry point and onboarding overview
- Login: User authentication flow
- Register: User registration flow

## Notes
These wireframes were created before backend implementation to reduce ambiguity and guide API contracts.
